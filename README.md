# SAN
Stochastic answering network for Squad 2.0

## Objectives
* [x] Reproduce results of the joint SAN and joint SAN + classifier. (Note the training of these models is the same so computationally, it shouldnâ€™t be very expensive to reproduce both results as compared to just one.)
* [x] Plot Lspan, Lclassifier, and overall loss and also training accuracy and f1 with epochs.
* [ ] Reproduce the classifier accuracy.
* [ ] Report other metrics - precision, recall, accuracy f1 for joint, joint+classifier, and on classifier alone as well.
* [x] Experiment with different lambdas in the loss function and see how accuracy of classifier changes. (In case this gets computationally very expensive, we can discuss what to do about it later)

### Installation and setup

* Requires Python3+ and pip3 to be installed
* To install all dependancies:
    * ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
    * ```python3 -m spacy download "en"```
    * ```get_data.sh```

### Setting and up and training the model
* Download the datasets: ```./get_data.sh```
* Pre-process the data ```./preprocess.sh```
* Train the model ```./train.sh``` (Recommended to use ```train.py``` with correct arguements instead)
* Plot graphs ```./plot_results.py``` (graphs are stored in plot/)
