Toak Chocolate is an Ecuadorian luxury chocolate company that was founded in
2013 by Jerry Toth, Carl Schweizer and Dennise Valencia.
Toak is pronounced Toe-Ahk. The luxury brand Toak, produces chocolate
with the very rare variety of Arriba cacao called Nacional cocoa, which some
experts formerly believed to be extinct. It is said to have more floral notes
and richness of flavors than any other cacao variety. The Heirloom Nacional
cacao bar produced by Toak Chocolate is considered to be the most expensive
chocolate bar in the world.
