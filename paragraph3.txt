Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani) is a deemed
university and Institute of Eminence under Section 3 of the UGC Act 1956 for
higher education and research in India. The institute is backed by the
Aditya Birla Group and is one of the first six institutes to be awarded the
Institute of Eminence status in 2018. After expansion to a campus in Dubai,
 it has become the first international deemed university,
 spearheading in science, engineering and research with 4 established campuses
 and 15 academic departments. It focuses primarily on higher education and
 research in engineering and sciences. Its history, influence, wealth and
 endowments have made it one of India's most prestigious universities.

The institute was established in its present form in 1964. During this period,
the institute's transformation from a regional engineering college to a national
university was backed by G.D. Birla. It is the only deemed university that has
been on par with IITs and NITs/RECs and has expanded its campuses from
Pilani to Goa, Hyderabad and Dubai. BITS alumni have continued to strongly shape
the Indian economy and culture. Through its highly successful and widespread
alumni network spanning globally across varied fields, BITS Pilani has made a
significant impact on corporates, academia, research, entrepreneurship, arts
and social activism.

BITS conducts the All-India computerized entrance examination, BITSAT
(BITS Admission Test). Admission is purely merit-based, as assessed by the
BITSAT examination. The fully residential institute is privately supported.
